# nonlinearOptimization
Showcases a couple Machine Learning Algorithms implemented in Python using Non-linear Regressions for the Model.

armijoNewton.py
-----------------
Script that curve matches an inputed function using the "Armijo" and "Newton" Conditions. You can input
your own function by going into the python code and editing the inputs that listed at the bottom of the code.

lineSearches.py
----------------
Does examples of line searches by use of algorithms listed in the code. You can use your own inputs and functions by
editing the inputs listed at the bottom of the code.
